Weather Analysis for Surf & Shake Shop in Oahu

## Analysis Overview
After visiting the island of Oahu, I fell in love with the sport of surfing. I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in Oahu and especially my experience learning how to surf so much so that I have been inspired to open up my own surf and ice cream shop. This dream cannot become a reality without ample financial resources and a lucrative business model. Therefore, I analyzed weather data in Oahu to ensure that my dream shop would be a frequented business by locals and tourists year round. The results of this analysis would serve to give potential investors confidence in my entrepreneurial endeavors.

## Results

The findings of my analyis were all fairly positive as pictured in the following summaries:

### June:

### December:

* The average temperature in June and Decemember are fairly similar at around 75 degrees in June and 71 degrees in December. This is perfect weather for surfng and ice cream, all good signs for my business.  

* The minimum temperature in December was recorded at 56 degrees. This data point shows that there is potential for much colder weather in December as compared to June which records a minimum possible temperature at 64 degrees. I will have to become creative in my business practices so that I can pivot and still guarantee business on colder days. To account for this, I will ensure that my shop is adequately supplied with warming wet suits and offer hot chocolate and tea in case there is a drop in the weather. Despite this finding, I am still fairly confident in the weather given the the relative stability of temperatures as explained in the next bullet point.

* The data shows that the STD is around 3.26 in June and 3.74 in December, fairly low values for STD. The fairly low Standard Deviations in both summaries shows that temperatures are fairly stable year-round. More stability means that I don't have to factor in a lot of risk based on fluctuating or extreme weather patterns. 

### Summary
The data paresented in this analysis shows that temperature weather patterns in Oahu are relatively stable and warm. These findings are conducive towards a successful Surf and Shake business. Despite my confidence in stable temperatures, it would be beneficial to run a similar query and view the statistical summaries of Precipitiation data in the same months. Given the tropical climate of Hawaii, higher temperatures are expected year round so I would like to analyze how much rain I can typically expect in those same months. 

An additional query can be done to review weather data across a calendar year as opposed to just these two months. There might be other times of the year with much colder temperatures or higher rainfall. This would help me uncover any recurring weather patterns providing the necessary tools to create reliable business projections. If I know when to expect slower business, I can take certain measures to alleviate any immediate impacts to revenue, securing longevity through preparedness.
